# üó∫Ô∏è [SUNY Oswego Asset Map Interface](https://oswego-map.herokuapp.com/) üó∫Ô∏è
Currently, a test deployment is running on a Heroku Dyno.  A work-flow is set up to keep the dyno awake.
## :question: Description :question:
A MapboxGL-JS driven front-end application meant to provide a visual means of interacting with SUNY Oswego's inventory 
system.  "Inventory" in this case can be anything from a smoke detector to a building itself.  Currently, the assets are
presented in parent-child relationship with the building's serving as a prent to the smaller assets. The web application is powered
by a Spring Boot web server API for serving web content as well as data from a SQL based database.
### :ballot_box_with_check: Current Features :ballot_box_with_check:
- Essential map controls (zoom, rotate, pitch, etc.), Satellite/Stylistic toggle 
- Map meta-data updates on mouse movement, touchscreen interaction
- Campus region quick navigation drop-down
- Building Data Context Box
  - Populates upon interaction
  - Populates list of assets belonging to buildings
  - Map centers on building upon click
  - Shows image in heading if image available
- Asset Data Context Box
  - Populates upon selection via asset dropdown in building context box
  - Refocus parent building (say if map moves out of view)
- Data Storage
  - Sample data of assets and buildings currently stored in H2 in-memory database
  - Building data also stored in MapBox tileset (GeoJSON)
### :soon: Proposed Features :soon:
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Search functionality for finding assets
- Connectivity with production sized SQL database
  - Use H2 only for testing
- More useful data layers such as:
  - Specific equipment locations
  - Malfunctioning equipment
  - Live data of equipment metrics
- Direct integration with AIM Assetworks via API
- Energy Usage Map (likely its own project)
### ‚ùó Known Issues ‚ùó
- Requires more datasets as well as variety of data to experiment with additional data layers
- Requires a styling overhaul
- Limited asset data available currently
    - When larger data sets are available will require more efficient means of sorting, filtering, paging etc.
- Limited exception handling for both front and back-end

## :handshake: Contributing :handshake:
There are numerous ways for this project to be improved upon.  We feel one of the best ways to see this project
fleshed out and actualized over time is to open it up to open-source contributing in addition to whomever may be working
on it on an official basis.  Contributions can come from anyone whether they be hobby programmers, staff and or other students
at the SUNY Oswego Campus or elsewhere. It's also possible to potentially refactor this project to suit your own campus's
needs.
